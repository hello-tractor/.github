# Hello Tractor 🚜 | Code for Africa's Food Systems

Welcome to the Hello Tractor GitHub Org! We’re a pan-African agritech company using hardware + software + data to revolutionize how farming works for smallholder farmers.

We deploy connected tractors, custom logistics systems, smart apps, and embeddable tools to create reliable, affordable access to mechanization across 18+ African countries.

## What We Build

This GitHub org contains public-facing tools, APIs, and SDKs used in our developer and partner ecosystem.

## What we’re building:

- 🧠 **Fleet management** — Monitor usage, fuel, location, and health of equipment in real time
- 📲 **Farmer and Operator Apps** — Lightweight, offline-first apps that connect 2M+ farmers to services, financing, and training.
- 🧩 **Book Now Widgets** — Embeddable tools for partners and businesses to bring Hello Tractor services anywhere.
- 🌍 **APIs + SDKs** — We’re opening up our platform so agribusinesses, partners, and innovators can build on top of our rails.
